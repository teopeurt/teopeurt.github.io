      <title>What is QT on Android?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to port those brilliant Nokia applications and QT based apps to Android without rewriting your code or having to learn what a Java Interface is? Necessitas to the rescue! - though you still have to learn Java if you want to be serious on the Android, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necessitas allows you port and write QT based applications for Android. For those who are familiar with QT - it is/was the best C++ framework ever invented - opinions clearly my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look &lt;a href=&#34;http://necessitas.kde.org/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for good introduction and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://community.kde.org/Necessitas&#34;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; if you want to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necessitas is a KDE community project aimed to provide an easy way to develop Qt apps on Android platform.
Necessitas comes from the need of exploiting the power and the multi-platform capabilities of the Qt  framework on the Android world. It was born as a concept work which demonstrates the flexibility of Qt and, today, strives to become a fully  working development solution for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the brainchild of 31 year old Romanian Bogdan Vatra. He did an interview with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.behindkde.org/node/925&#34;&gt;Behind KDE&lt;/a&gt;. His introduction to the Android platform SDK was similar to mine - doing custom Android builds on embedded devices, though mine was at TomTom and Renault. Here is an excerpt of how he started work on Necessitas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How old is the Qt on Android project?  Who started it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to port Qt to Android at the end of 2009. When I started it the name was android-lighthouse but I had to change the name to &amp;ldquo;Necessitas&amp;rdquo; just before the SDK release because Nokia and Google didn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to use Qt and/or Android words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://labs.qt.nokia.com/&#34;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, a research project started by Nokia, helped me a lot. This project made my life very easy, the changes I had to make were only a small set of changes into the Qt tree. The &amp;ldquo;biggest change&amp;rdquo; was to add another shared memory implementation based on ashmem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series of post on QT. I will actually go through the steps for creating an android application using the brilliant QT Quick and &lt;a href=&#34;http://qt.nokia.com/qtquick/&#34;&gt;QML&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to BackUp</title>
      <link>http://blog.teopeurt.com/2011/09/15/how-to-backup/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.teopeurt.com/2011/09/15/how-to-backup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t break what works - this constant to re-invent the wheel! sheesh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is Emacs broken, is Gnutils?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the very unhelpful advice on &lt;a title=&#34;Ubuntu backup&#34; href=&#34;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; on how to backup - I have stolen the old notes from jwz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html&#34;&gt;http://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You have a computer. It came with a hard drive in it. Go buy two more drives of the same size or larger. If the drive in your computer is SATA2, get SATA2. If it&#39;s a 2.5&amp;quot; laptop drive, get two of those. Brand doesn&#39;t matter, but physical measurements and connectors should match.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Get external enclosures for both of them. The enclosures are under $30.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Put one of these drives in its enclosure on your desk. Name it something clever like &amp;quot;Backup&amp;quot;. If you are using a Mac, the command you use to back up is below, If you&#39;re using Linux, it&#39;s something a lot like that. If you&#39;re using Windows, go fuck yourself. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

sudo rsync -vaxAX --delete --ignore-errors / /Volumes/Backup/


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you have a desktop computer, have this happen every morning at 5AM by creating a temporary text file containing this line:&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


0 5 * * * rsync -vaxAX --delete --ignore-errors / /Volumes/Backup/


&lt;p&gt;and then doing&lt;/p&gt;


sudo crontab -u root 


&lt;p&gt;that-file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you have a laptop, do that before you go to bed. Really. Every night when you plug your laptop in to charge.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you&#39;re on a Mac, that backup drive will be &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bootable.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; That means that when (WHEN) your internal drive scorches itself, you can just take your backup drive and put it in your computer and go. This is nice.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;When (WHEN) your backup drive goes bad, which you will notice because your last backup failed, replace it immediately. This is your number one priority. Don&#39;t wait until the weekend when you have time, do it now, before you so much as &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;touch&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; your computer again. Do it before goddamned breakfast. The universe tends toward maximum irony. Don&#39;t push it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;That third drive? Do a backup onto it the same way, then take that to your office and lock it in a desk. Every few months, bring it home, do a backup, and immediately take it away again. This is your &amp;quot;my house burned down&amp;quot; backup.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;OMG, three drives is so expensive! That sounds like a hassle!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; Shut up. I know things. You will listen to me. Do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent advice!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Not to Hack the Android Framework</title>
      <link>http://blog.teopeurt.com/2011/06/22/hacking-android-framework/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.teopeurt.com/2011/06/22/hacking-android-framework/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;meta&#34;&gt;22 June 2011 - Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short dump of my notes to a customer who hacked the Android framework to create a custom build for their project. The resulting system was unstable and my job was to find out why (and fix it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing a stock android emulator (both 2.2 and 2.3), we see comparable values for highly graphic intensive apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference in system-server could be down to our additions and the amount of processes - for each process needs to
communicate it&amp;rsquo;s state and activities to system_server (package manager, activity manager etc, ContentProvider resolver), the more the process, the more
the messages as the framework need to know which activities, services, providers and broadcast is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have instrumented the framework and could not find any extra  messages due to increased CotentProvider usages or broadcast recievers, although I can now track the message to the actual package/classs
the quantity/frequencty was sufficiently low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;system_server crashes because it has run out of FD(file descriptors!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
