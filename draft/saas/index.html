<p>TLDR: Will SAAS work in Africa? FABA</p>

<p>I gto to thinking about SAAS architectures and how relevant it is to my experiment with creating a product company.</p>

<p>When your customers are in the millions and they all have a credit card, a SAAS product success is a matter of marketing not technology and meeting their need. This is commonly referred to as B2C. This applies to products that sell the consumer - i.e. facebook, Google, twitter et al.</p>

<p>There exists a small niche which I call Pick Axe sellers, these are companies that have grown up to serve the needs of the SAAS themselves. They sell tech platforms, montitoring, etc. As in life these are my general observations and as such none exists in a vaccum and their loci overlaps.</p>

<p>The traditional African IT company is a service company, ultra-local and an expertise in the landscape. Some may have struck it big by partnerting with a large NGO, Bank or possibly a major Government contract, but the majority are still just tweaking CMS platforms to satisfy their underpaying clients. Granted the underpaying clients are underpaying because no one has ever given them a true valuatuion of the increase in profits a properly executed website can give.</p>

<p>Again feel free to point me to anecdotes and companies doing things differently,</p>

<p>The price of technology has reduced drastically, mainly caused by the excess introduced with the first and secodn group above.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t found no equivalent creative agencies of the size and influence</p>
