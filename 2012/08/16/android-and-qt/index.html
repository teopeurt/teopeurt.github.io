      <p>Do you want to port those brilliant Nokia applications and QT based apps to Android without rewriting your code or having to learn what a Java Interface is? Necessitas to the rescue! - though you still have to learn Java if you want to be serious on the Android, but I digress.</p>

<p>Necessitas allows you port and write QT based applications for Android. For those who are familiar with QT - it is/was the best C++ framework ever invented - opinions clearly my own.</p>

<p>Look <a href="http://necessitas.kde.org/">here</a> for good introduction and the <a href="http://community.kde.org/Necessitas">community</a> if you want to tinker.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Necessitas is a KDE community project aimed to provide an easy way to develop Qt apps on Android platform.
Necessitas comes from the need of exploiting the power and the multi-platform capabilities of the Qt  framework on the Android world. It was born as a concept work which demonstrates the flexibility of Qt and, today, strives to become a fully  working development solution for Android.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the brainchild of 31 year old Romanian Bogdan Vatra. He did an interview with <a href="http://www.behindkde.org/node/925">Behind KDE</a>. His introduction to the Android platform SDK was similar to mine - doing custom Android builds on embedded devices, though mine was at TomTom and Renault. Here is an excerpt of how he started work on Necessitas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How old is the Qt on Android project?  Who started it?</strong></p>

<p>I started to port Qt to Android at the end of 2009. When I started it the name was android-lighthouse but I had to change the name to &ldquo;Necessitas&rdquo; just before the SDK release because Nokia and Google didn&rsquo;t allow me to use Qt and/or Android words.</p>

<p><a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/">Lighthouse</a>, a research project started by Nokia, helped me a lot. This project made my life very easy, the changes I had to make were only a small set of changes into the Qt tree. The &ldquo;biggest change&rdquo; was to add another shared memory implementation based on ashmem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post is part of a series of post on QT. I will actually go through the steps for creating an android application using the brilliant QT Quick and <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/qtquick/">QML</a>.</p>
