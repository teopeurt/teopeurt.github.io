    <article>
      <p>I am a huge fan of <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and have been for many years. I tend to go through a lot of developer machines and thus will need to set up my dev environment really quickly - I only use Linux or Apple&rsquo;s Mac so a shell script normally works for me. Two invaluable tools I have come to love over the years is <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> and <a href="http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools">P4Merge</a> by Perforce. As an aside Perforce is actually a proprietary version control system used in Enterprise but P4Merge is a free tool.</p>

<p>One of the things everyone encounters when using Git are merge conflicts and this is where a visual tool is invaluable. I hate having to learn a new tool as my attention span is very limited and thus P4Merge does it for me. YMMV.</p>

<p>Sourcetree was an application originally developed for Mac OS X but was since acquired by Atlassian - owners of Bitbucket - so it has very good integration.</p>

<p>Git itself has a major learning curve but the investment is very much worth it. My advice is to take baby steps and don&rsquo;t try to get into the holy wars about branching models etc - e.g whether <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a> is good for you or not.</p>
