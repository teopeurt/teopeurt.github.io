      <p>Having the been to a few hackathons, I have witnessed the somewhat explosive fame of a few entrants. Beyond what they have built - most people build really awesome things - I have noticed a similarity to those who go on family..</p>

<p>Its really all about the narrative, the ability to put in words ( and stir the emotional space) with alluring pictures and anecdotes. To break into the field, you have to have a good combination of telling a good story. These guys are good engineers, but beyond being great at what they do, they are excellent orators and public speakers.</p>

<p>But how do we as mere mortals get to this stage? Well beyond attending hackathons which are not suitable for everyone - especially with a family. I suggest going to meet-ups and presenting on a topic.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set a target to do as many speaking engagements as possible - just like coding the more you do, the better you get.</li>
<li>Do a monthly review and assessment of your progress</li>
<li>Write every-day, thoughts and critics and what you have read. Do not necessarily make it public, journals have been a staple of our engineering diet for eons.</li>
<li>Do tutorials and training</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, a lesson is nothing without exercise and practice, so go forth and multiply.</p>

<p>This helps to build your narrative skills, as it breaks the anxiety barrier and lets you explore your creativity, thereby making a the world a better place.</p>
